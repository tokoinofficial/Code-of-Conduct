Tokoin: Code of Conduct

## Who Must Follow Our Code?

We expect all of our employees to know and follow the coding standard.

## Take Action:

Any time you feel our users aren't being well-served, don't be bashful - let someone in the company know about it. Continually improving our products and services takes all of us.

## Support Each Other:

Communication through any of channels (GitHub, mailing lists, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

## Avoid Conflicts:

When considering a course of action, ask yourself whether the action you're considering could create an incentive for you, or appear to others to create an incentive for you, to benefit yourself, your friends or family, or an associated business at the expense of Tokoin. If the answer is "yes," the action you're considering is likely to create a conflict of interest situation, and you should avoid it.

If any member violates this code of conduct, the team leader may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or firing/blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.
